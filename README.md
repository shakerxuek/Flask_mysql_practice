Overall, this is a ORM task and I eventually achieved the CRUD of the logs.   
I have tested the code on postman. It works fine.
The source code is app.py and I tried to achieve the hierarchy structure for actions in test.py.

I provide the REST status code for the DELETE and POST.

In order to make solution cloud-scalable, application code should be managed by a version control system such as git. Using standardized processes to automate configuration and reduce developer learning costs. Make it decoupled from the operating system so that it can provide maximum portability between systems. Should be Suitable for deployment on modern cloud computing platforms, saving resources in server and system management. Minimize differences between development and production environments and implement agile development using continuous delivery. Scale can be achieved without significant changes in tools, architecture and development process.
